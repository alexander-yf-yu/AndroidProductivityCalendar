To get our android application running. We pulled from the repository using Android Studio. Then create an android studio project when prompted. Choose the phase 2 folder then Phase2Calender as the location of the project. On the next prompt select unmark all and then click the finish button on the bottom. Now the project should be created. We ran the project on a pixel 3a emulator running Andriod version R. That can be created on the top right, inside Android Studio. Inside AVD manager, choose pixel 3a and then build and run the app on the virtual device.
